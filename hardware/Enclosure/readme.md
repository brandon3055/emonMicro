# Caution!

If you choose to build these monitors I recommend using a properly rated off the shelf enclosure. 
Failure of the enclosure could result in electrocution. 

If you do choose to print these enclosures I recommend a minimum of 4 perimeters, 5 top/bottom layers and 40% cubic infill.
And please...
#### Do not use PLA!
Seriously. PLA is great for toys and trinkets but with a glass transition temp of 60C you may as well be using candle wax.
I used ABS for my enclosures but PETG *may* also be acceptable.

Just keep in mind if the enclosure fails someone could be electrocuted. So be sure you know what you are doing.
